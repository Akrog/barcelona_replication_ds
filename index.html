# Cinder Replication Design Session

## Barcelona OpenStack Summit

Ocata Release<br>
October 27th 2016

# DESIGN SESSION

## CINDER REPLICATION

**Links:**

- Etherpad: https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/ocata-cinder-summit-replication
- Slides: https://akrog.github.io/barcelona_replication_ds

**Topics:**

- Existing bugs
- Driver consistency
- Support of Active-Active
- Failback
- Promote secondary

# REPLICATION BUGS

## CINDER REPLICATION

We should fix all bugs in Ocata:

- API request has no `host` ➔ `KeyError` exception
- There are unit tests for manager's `failover_host`:
  - `InvalidReplicationTarget` for secondary to secondary failover ➔ Wrong `replication_status`
  - `VolumeDriverException` ➔  Setting non existent attribute `service.status`
  - On `volumes` DB update error ➔ Report failover success
      - *What should we do?*
- Some drivers don't support "default" value for `secondary_backend_id` ➔ Not documented
- Freeze mechanism doesn't work

---

# FREEZE MECHANISM BUG

## https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1616974

- Delete still works
- Only prevents operations going through the scheduler
- *Freeze* = *Disabled*
- Some solutions, simple to complex:
  - Drivers ignore operations when frozen
  - Make API check service status on specific operations
  - All operations go through the scheduler ➔ Stop them there
      - Will allow us to also do real Disable of services
      - To be effective API RPC calls would be sync ➔ Slower

---

# DRIVER CONSISTENCY

## CINDER REPLICATION

Key information missing from specs:

- Support "default" value for `secondary_backend_id`
- Volume's `replication_status`
  - On creation ➔ `ReplicationStatus.DISABLED` or `ReplicationStatus.ENABLED`
  - On failover ➔ `ReplicationStatus.FAILED_OVER`
- On failover non replicated volume's status ➔ `"error"`

---

# Support of Active-Active

## https://review.openstack.org/381835

- Replication v2.2
- New `failover` API endpoint accepting `host` and `cluster`
- Backward compatible
- We split `failover_host` in 2:
  - `failover` ➔ Only makes changes to volumes at backend
  - `failover_completed` ➔ Running driver points to new backend
- Prevent unusable case:
  - Replication enabled
  - Active-Active enabled
  - Driver doesn't implement new methods

---

# FAILBACK

Is it enough failing over to "default"?

- Fix drivers to support "default" as `secondary_backend_id`?
- Document it: Amend specs or add to v2.2

---

# PROMOTE SECONDARY

## .small-text[https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/cinder-specs/specs/newton/cheesecake-promote-backend.html]

- API needs to tell drivers that the backend has been promoted:
  - They need to change volumes' `replication_status`
  - They many need to do other things:
      - Change `replication_extended_status`, `replication_driver_data`...
- `reset-active-backend` API sets `replication_status=disabled`
  - Why default to disabled? We may have multiple replication backends
- `replication-enable` API to change service's `replication_status`
  - Field is only informative
      - Not used by the scheduler
      - Not used by drivers ➔ Report based on `replication_devices`
- Why not use `cinder-manage service remove` command?
